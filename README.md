## Tech Stack 🛠️

The tools behind the project

![Tech Stack](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=typescript,react,next,tailwind)

- **TypeScript**: Chosen for its static typing, which helps catch errors early and improves code maintainability.
- **React**: Selected for its component-based architecture, making the UI modular and reusable.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for its utility-first approach, allowing for rapid and responsive design development.
- **Next.js**: Selected for its performance benefits and server-side rendering. ⚠️ While it's more than what this project requires, I included since it's part of the Concourse stack.
